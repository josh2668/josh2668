This repo holds all of the projects, notes, and write-ups I have done while completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

<!---You can view my certificate of completion on Credly or Coursera.--->

In this course I gained foundational knowledge that will prepare me for entry-level jobs in cybersecurity and help me understand how security teams protect their organizations and its customers.

This course covered many conceptual topics such as:

- Risk management
- Threat analysis
- Network security
- Incident response

It also taught me technical skills with:

- Linux
- Python
- SQL
- SIEM tools (Splunk and Chronicle)
- Network protocol analyzers (Wireshark and tcpdump)
- IDS/IPS tools
- Firewalls

Each directory holds the files for each of the courses in the certificate and the order they were completed in is:

1. Foundations of Cybersecurity
2. Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks
3. Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security
4. Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL
5. Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
6. Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response
7. Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python
8. Put It to Work: Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs (No files needed)
